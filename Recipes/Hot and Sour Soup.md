2. Mix pork strips with 1 tbsp water until absorbed, then add pinch of salt, 2 tsp neutral oil, and 1 tsp cornstarch. set aside to marinate.
3. Slice tofu, bamboo shoots, and carrots into thin strips. Beat the egg and chop scallions for garnish.
4. Heat neutral oil in a hot pan/pot and briefly fry dried chilies until fragrant. Add 6-8 cups of chicken stock to the pan and bring to a boil. Add pork and stir, ensuring the strips are separated.
5. Add rehydrated mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and carrots. Simmer for 2 minutes. Stir in soy sauces, salt, sugar, white pepper, and sesame oil. Let simmer. [^1]
6. Stir in a cornstarch slurry (2 tbsp cornstarch + 2 tbsp water) in a thin stream while stirring the soup. Cook until slightly thickened. Add tofu and simmer briefly. Stir soup in one direction and slowly pour in the beaten egg to create ribbons, then give one gentle stir.
7. Turn off heat. Add black vinegar and more white pepper, then taste and adjust for more heat or sourness as desired. Garnish with scallions and serve and enjoy.
