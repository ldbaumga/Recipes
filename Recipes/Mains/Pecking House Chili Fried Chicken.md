### Peking House Fried Chicken

>Notes: Recipe can also be found [here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pecking-house-chili-fried-chicken-recipe/) but measurements for marinade seem to make a large batch, so I've adjusted the quantity. The source video also does not measure, just uses spoonful's of stuff.

### Ingredients
- [ ] 3 - 4 lbs. whole chicken, broken down with skin on [[Butchering a Chicken - 10 Piece Country Cut]]

##### Seasoning Mix
- [ ] 6 tbsp | 75g kosher salt
- [ ] 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- [ ] 2 tablespoons MSG

##### Chicken Marinade
- [ ] 1 cup buttermilk
- [ ] 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- [ ] 2 tbsp  all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1 tbsp five-spice powder
- [ ] .5 tbsp seasoning blend
- [ ] 1 tbsp garlic powder
- [ ] 1 tbsp onion powder

##### Dredge
- [ ] 3 cups | 440g all-purpose flour
- [ ] 0.75 cup | 115g potato starch
- [ ] 0.75 cup | 110g corn starch
- [ ] 3 tbsp seasoning blend

### Intro

### Directions
1. Mix all ingredients for the seasoning mix together in a small bowl.
2. Mix all marinade ingredients together. This should form a paste. 
3. Toss chicken in the paste and marinade for 24 hrs.
4. Preheat oil to 325 F. Mix the dredge ingredients together in a bowl.
5. Take the chicken from the marinade, cover in the dredge, and fry in the oil until chicken is cooked through. Place on a wire rack to cool/drain.
6. Bring oil back to 325 F and fry chicken again for 2-3 minutes to crisp the chicken. Place back on wire rack and immediately cover in [[Pecking House Chili Paste]] (or chili oil).

Can also make [[Pecking House Green Garlic Ranch]] to dip in.
