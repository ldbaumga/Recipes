### Directions
1. Chop the garlic stem and herbs into chunks, and blend with the canola oil.
2. Pour the blended mixture into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil for 1-2 minutes, then place pan in an ice bath to stop the cooking, this will prevent the chlorophyll from being overcooked and will keep the green color.
